Macro-based CLI Demo
====================

This example demonstrates the power of sw-cli macros for building CLIs.

Features:
- Count lines in files with --count
- Search for patterns with --pattern
- Reverse line order with --reverse
- Full support for stdin/stdout
- Dry-run mode with -n
- Verbose mode with -v

Examples:
  macro-cli-demo --count -i file.txt
  macro-cli-demo -p "pattern" -i file.txt
  macro-cli-demo --reverse -i file.txt
  echo "test" | macro-cli-demo --count
  macro-cli-demo -n --count -i file.txt

The implementation is dramatically simpler than the manual version:
- Config generation: ~5 lines vs ~23 lines
- Builder: Automatic vs ~28 lines
- Commands: ~15 lines each vs ~50 lines each
